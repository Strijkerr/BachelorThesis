For more information about this project, see the full thesis at: "https://theses.liacs.nl/xxxxxxxxxxx"

This project requires 29+36GB of free space.

Several libraries might be needed to run everything, terminal should signal which ones are missing.

For opening this project in Visual Studio Code or any other IDE with a file tracker, add '**/OpenDataUitspraken/**' to the 'watcher exclude' (too many files to track otherwise).

If running for the first time, git clone this project in your map of choice by typing this in the terminal:
1. git clone "https://github.com/Kroonkurk/BachelorThesis.git"

When the cloning is complete, go to the working directory 'BachelorThesis'.

2. cd BachelorThesis 

Launch 'menu.py' from the working directory to go through the steps of setting up the datasets. Launching can be done by typing the following in the terminal:

3. python3 menu.py

A setup menu should be visible in which you can download the datasets('1'), unzip&unpack('2') and filter('3') them. After going through all steps, one can exit 'setup.py' by pressing '4'. 

Estimated times: step 1: < 0.5 hours, step 2: < 2 hours and step 3: < 1 hours.
